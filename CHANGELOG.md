## Breaking change

HearthStats has not been updated for Mean Streets of Gadgetzan and will likely remain unmaintained.
Syncing causes your local decks to lose their MSG cards. HearthStats support is now disabled for all users.

We are very sorry about the inconvenience and are working on a much improved replacement system!

## Breaking change 2

Starting from this version, HSTracker is signed with my Apple developper account. You have to download manually this version from [hsdecktracker.net](https://hsdecktracker.net/hstracker/download/) since the update system will not allow this signature change.

## Breaking change 3

HSTracker now use a new system to improve your tracking. It allows HSTracker to auto-import decks from Hearthstone, detect ranks, game modes, ...
You will be asked to authorize HSTracker to read the memory of Hearthstone. There's no other modification done to your system.
_Please note_ that this version will delete your statistics, this is due to a big modification of the statistic system.
