/** @brief Class implementing the FREAK (*Fast Retina Keypoint*) keypoint descriptor, described in @cite AOV12 .

The algorithm propose a novel keypoint descriptor inspired by the human visual system and more
precisely the retina, coined Fast Retina Key- point (FREAK). A cascade of binary strings is
computed by efficiently comparing image intensities over a retinal sampling pattern. FREAKs are in
general faster to compute with lower memory load and also more robust than SIFT, SURF or BRISK.
They are competitive alternatives to existing keypoints in particular for embedded applications.

/** latch Class for computing the LATCH descriptor.
If you find this code useful, please add a reference to the following paper in your work:
Gil Levi and Tal Hassner, "LATCH: Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes", arXiv preprint arXiv:1501.03719, 15 Jan. 2015

LATCH is a binary descriptor based on learned comparisons of triplets of image patches.

* bytes is the size of the descriptor - can be 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1
* rotationInvariance - whether or not the descriptor should compansate for orientation changes.
* half_ssd_size - the size of half of the mini-patches size. For example, if we would like to compare triplets of patches of size 7x7x
    then the half_ssd_size should be (7-1)/2 = 3.

Note: the descriptor can be coupled with any keypoint extractor. The only demand is that if you use set rotationInvariance = True then
    you will have to use an extractor which estimates the patch orientation (in degrees). Examples for such extractors are ORB and SIFT.

Note: a complete example can be found under /samples/cpp/tutorial_code/xfeatures2D/latch_match.cpp

/** @brief Class implementing the MSD (*Maximal Self-Dissimilarity*) keypoint detector, described in @cite Tombari14.

The algorithm implements a novel interest point detector stemming from the intuition that image patches
which are highly dissimilar over a relatively large extent of their surroundings hold the property of
being repeatable and distinctive. This concept of "contextual self-dissimilarity" reverses the key
paradigm of recent successful techniques such as the Local Self-Similarity descriptor and the Non-Local
Means filter, which build upon the presence of similar - rather than dissimilar - patches. Moreover,
it extends to contextual information the local self-dissimilarity notion embedded in established
detectors of corner-like interest points, thereby achieving enhanced repeatability, distinctiveness and
localization accuracy.
